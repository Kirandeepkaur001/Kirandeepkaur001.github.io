# PC & Network Troubleshooting

### GPU
GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit. A GPU is a part of the computer that helps to show pictures, videos, and games on the screen smoothly. It’s a special processor designed to handle graphics and images, like in video games, videos, and 3D rendering.

* Works alongside the CPU
* Great at doing many tasks at once (parallel processing)
* Speeds up drawing images, videos, and animations
* Also used for AI, machine learning, and scientific calculations

  ### ** Why do we need a GPU?_**
  * To play games without lag.
  * To watch high-quality videos.
  * To create animations or edit videos.
  * To help in working with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data.

  ### **_Types of GPU_**

    ### **_Integrated GPU_**
    * Already inside the computer (e.g., laptops).
    * Not very powerful.

    ### **_Dedicated GPU_**
    * A separate part you add to the computer.
    * Very powerful (used for gaming and video editing).
      
  ### **_Common Symptoms of GPU Issues_**

    ### **_No Display on Screen_**
    The computer is on, but the screen is black.

    **_Weird Colors or Lines_**
    You see strange lines, colors, or patterns on the screen.

    ### **_Screen Flickering_**  
    The screen keeps blinking or shaking.

    ### **_Game Crashes or Freezes_**
    When you play games, they suddenly close or get stuck.

    ### **_Overheating_**
    The GPU gets very hot. The computer fan runs loudly.

    ### **_Low FPS in Games_**
    Games run slowly or look choppy (not smooth).

    ### **_Error Messages_**
    You may see errors like “Display driver stopped responding.”

    ### **_Blue Screen (BSOD)_**
    Your computer suddenly shows a blue screen and restarts.

    ### **_Noisy Fan_**
    The GPU fan makes loud or strange noises.

    ### **_Computer Shuts Down_**
      Your system turns off suddenly, especially while gaming or using graphics-heavy apps.

### Partitioning of Hard Disk
A partition is like dividing your hard disk into separate sections (like making rooms in a house).

You can store different things in each section, like:
* One for Windows
* One for personal files (photos, videos)
* One for backups or another OS (like Linux)

Just like:
* C: drive → Windows system files
* D: drive → Movies, songs, documents
* E: drive → Backups or another OS

  ### **_Types of Partitions_**
  
    ### **_Primary Partition_**
    * You can install an operating system here.
    * Max 4 primary partitions (in MBR type).

    ### **_Extended Partition_**
    * Used to create more partitions inside it (logical partitions).
      
    ### **_Logical Partition_**
    * Made inside an extended partition.
    * Used for storing data.

  ### **_ Why Partition?_**
  * To organize your files better.
  * To keep system and data separate.
  * To install multiple operating systems.
  * To make backup and formatting easier.

### Causes of a Slow PC (Why computer becomes slow)

  **_Too Many Programs Running_**
  Many apps open at the same time use more memory (RAM).

  **_Low RAM_**
  Not enough memory to handle your tasks.

  **_Too Many Startup Apps_**
  Apps that open automatically when PC starts slow it down.

  **_Old Hard Disk (HDD)_**
  Traditional hard drives are slower than SSDs.

  **_Too Many Browser Tabs_**
  Chrome or other browsers use a lot of RAM.

  **_Viruses or Malware_**
  Harmful software makes the system slow or behaves oddly.

  **_Full Hard Disk_**
  If C: drive is almost full, Windows slows down.

  **_Outdated Software or Drivers_**
  Old versions can cause poor performance.

  **_Overheating_**
  PC gets hot and reduces speed to protect itself.

  **_Background Updates or Scans_**
  Antivirus or Windows updates running silently.

### Fixes for a Slow PC (How to make it faster)

| Problem               | Simple Fix                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too many apps running | Close unused apps                                               |
| Low RAM               | Add more RAM (if possible)                                      |
| Startup apps          | Disable startup apps (Task Manager → Startup tab)               |
| Old HDD               | Upgrade to SSD (Solid State Drive)                              |
| Too many tabs         | Close unused browser tabs                                       |
| Virus or malware      | Run antivirus scan (Windows Defender or others)                 |
| Full disk             | Delete unwanted files, use Disk Cleanup                         |
| Old software          | Update Windows and drivers                                      |
| Heating               | Clean fan, ensure good airflow                                  |
| Background tasks      | Turn off background apps (Settings → Privacy → Background Apps) |

### System Scanning
System Scanning means checking your computer for problems, like:
* Viruses
* Malware (bad programs)
* Corrupted files
* Missing system files

  **_Why do we do it?_**
  To keep your PC safe, clean, and fast.

  **_How to do a system scan?_**
  * Open Windows Security or Antivirus Software.
  * Click on Scan Now.
  * It checks the system and tells if any virus or issue is found.
  * You can then remove or fix the problem.

### Defragmentation
* Your hard disk stores files in small pieces. Over time, the pieces get scattered. This is called fragmentation.

* Defragmentation means putting all the scattered file pieces back together, so your computer can find them faster.
