# PC & Network Troubleshooting

# GPU
GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit. A GPU is a part of the computer that helps to show pictures, videos, and games on the screen smoothly. It’s a special processor designed to handle graphics and images, like in video games, videos, and 3D rendering.

* Works alongside the CPU
* Great at doing many tasks at once (parallel processing)
* Speeds up drawing images, videos, and animations
* Also used for AI, machine learning, and scientific calculations

  ### Why do we need a GPU?
  * To play games without lag.
  * To watch high-quality videos.
  * To create animations or edit videos.
  * To help in working with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data.

  ### Types of GPU :

  ### **_1. Integrated GPU_**
  * Already inside the computer (e.g., laptops).
  * Not very powerful.

  ### **_2. Dedicated GPU_**
  * A separate part you add to the computer.
  * Very powerful (used for gaming and video editing).
      
  ### Common Symptoms of GPU Issues :

  ### **_1. No Display on Screen_**
  The computer is on, but the screen is black.

  ### **_2. Weird Colors or Lines_**
  You see strange lines, colors, or patterns on the screen.

  ### **_3. Screen Flickering_**  
  The screen keeps blinking or shaking.

  ### **_4. Game Crashes or Freezes_**
  When you play games, they suddenly close or get stuck.

  ### **_5. Overheating_**
  The GPU gets very hot. The computer fan runs loudly.

  ### **_6. Low FPS in Games_**
  Games run slowly or look choppy (not smooth).

  ### **_7. Error Messages_**
  You may see errors like “Display driver stopped responding.”

  ### **_8. Blue Screen (BSOD)_**
  Your computer suddenly shows a blue screen and restarts.

  ### **_9. Noisy Fan_**
  The GPU fan makes loud or strange noises.

  ### **_10. Computer Shuts Down_**
  Your system turns off suddenly, especially while gaming or using graphics-heavy apps.

# Partitioning of Hard Disk
A partition is like dividing your hard disk into separate sections (like making rooms in a house).

You can store different things in each section, like:
* One for Windows
* One for personal files (photos, videos)
* One for backups or another OS (like Linux)

Just like:
* C: drive → Windows system files
* D: drive → Movies, songs, documents
* E: drive → Backups or another OS

  ### Types of Partitions :
  
  ### **_1. Primary Partition_**
  * You can install an operating system here.
  * Max 4 primary partitions (in MBR type).

  ### **_2. Extended Partition_**
  * Used to create more partitions inside it (logical partitions).
      
  ### **_3. Logical Partition_**
  * Made inside an extended partition.
  * Used for storing data.

  ### Why Partition?
  * To organize your files better.
  * To keep system and data separate.
  * To install multiple operating systems.
  * To make backup and formatting easier.

# Causes of a Slow PC (Why computer becomes slow) :

  ### **_1. Too Many Programs Running_**
  Many apps open at the same time use more memory (RAM).

  ### **_2. Low RAM_**
  Not enough memory to handle your tasks.

  ### **_3. Too Many Startup Apps_**
  Apps that open automatically when PC starts slow it down.

  ### **_4. Old Hard Disk (HDD)_**
  Traditional hard drives are slower than SSDs.

  ### **_5. Too Many Browser Tabs_**
  Chrome or other browsers use a lot of RAM.

  ### **_6. Viruses or Malware_**
  Harmful software makes the system slow or behaves oddly.

  ### **_7. Full Hard Disk_**
  If C: drive is almost full, Windows slows down.

  ### **_8. Outdated Software or Drivers_**
  Old versions can cause poor performance.

  ### **_9. Overheating_**
  PC gets hot and reduces speed to protect itself.

  ### **_10. Background Updates or Scans_**
  Antivirus or Windows updates running silently.

# System Scanning 
System Scanning means checking your computer for problems, like:
* Viruses
* Malware (bad programs)
* Corrupted files
* Missing system files

  ### Why do we do it?
  To keep your PC safe, clean, and fast.

  ### How to do a system scan?
  * Open Windows Security or Antivirus Software.
  * Click on Scan Now.
  * It checks the system and tells if any virus or issue is found.
  * You can then remove or fix the problem.

# Defragmentation
* Your hard disk stores files in small pieces. Over time, the pieces get scattered. This is called fragmentation.

* Defragmentation means putting all the scattered file pieces back together, so your computer can find them faster.

# Optimization

* Optimization means making your computer or software work faster and more efficiently. It involves cleaning up unnecessary files, fixing errors, managing startup programs, and adjusting settings so everything runs smoothly.

* By optimizing your system, you can improve speed, reduce crashes, and get better overall performance.

  ### **_Scheduled Optimization_**
  * Scheduled Optimization is setting your computer or device to automatically perform maintenance tasks at regular times—like cleaning up junk files, defragmenting the disk, or scanning for errors—without you having to do it manually.
  * This helps keep your system running smoothly and fast without interrupting your work.

  ### **_Delivery Optimization_**
  Delivery Optimization is a Windows feature that helps manage and speed up downloading Windows updates and Microsoft Store apps by using peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing across your local network or the internet.

# Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)
The Blue Screen of Death (also called STOP error) is when your computer suddenly stops working and shows a blue screen with a sad face and some error message.

  ### **_Why BSOD happens_**
  * Faulty or incompatible hardware (like bad RAM or hard drives)
  * Driver problems (corrupted or outdated drivers)
  * Software bugs or corrupted system files
  * Overheating or hardware failures
  * Malware or virus infections
  * Conflicts between software and hardware
  When BSOD occurs, Windows shows an error code to help identify the problem.

# System crash analysis
System crash analysis is the process of investigating why a computer suddenly stops working or restarts unexpectedly. The goal is to find the cause and fix it to prevent future crashes.

  ### **_How it’s done?_**

  * Check error messages or codes shown during the crash.
  * Review system logs using tools like Event Viewer.
  * Analyze crash dump files with utilities such as BlueScreenView or WinDbg.
  * Look for recent changes in hardware, software, or drivers that might have caused the crash.
  * Run hardware diagnostics to check for failing components.
    
  ### **_Fixes usually involve_**
  * Updating or rolling back drivers.
  * Removing problematic software.
  * Repairing corrupted system files.
  * Replacing faulty hardware.

# System Crash Analysis
System Crash Analysis is the process of diagnosing why a Windows system crashes, such as during a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), to identify and fix the root cause.

# Key Concepts
  ### **_Dump Files_**
  When Windows crashes, it creates dump files—snapshots of system memory at the crash moment. These files contain critical information to analyze the error and are usually saved on the C: drive in locations like:

  Having sufficient free space on the C: drive is essential to allow these files to be saved.

  ### **_Windows Debugging_**
  Windows debugging involves using specialized tools to analyze dump files and understand the crash cause. Common tools include:

  * **_WinDbg :_** Microsoft's official debugger for detailed dump analysis.
  * **_BlueScreenView :_** A simpler tool that summarizes BSOD dump files.

  Debugging helps identify :
  * Faulty drivers or system files
  * Hardware issues
  * Software conflicts
    
  ### **_Role of the C: Drive_**
  * Stores dump files and system logs
  * Houses Windows OS files required for crash analysis
  * Needs enough space to save crash dumps; without it, useful diagnostic data may be lost
    
  ### **_Basic Crash Analysis Workflow_**
  * Locate dump files on the C: drive.
  * Use debugging tools (WinDbg or BlueScreenView) to analyze the dumps.
  * Identify error codes and faulting modules or drivers.
  * Review Windows Event Viewer for related system events.
  * Test hardware components if indicated.
  * Update, rollback, or reinstall drivers/software as needed.
  * Monitor system for stability after applying fixes.
