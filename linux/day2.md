  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/884fa9e1-3ff3-4c51-b67e-bb392281eb98)
    ### Kernel:
    It is a program that is core of computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system. It interacts with hardware.
    ### Shell:
    It is a program that acts an interface between user and operating system.
    
    ### Types of Shell:
    ### **_Bash_** :
    Most commmon (friendlist)
      
    A Command-Line Interpreter (Shell)
    Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell.
    It is the program you use to type commands in Linux or Mac. It lets you talk to the computer using text.

    ðŸ’¬ Think of it like:
    A messenger between you and the computerâ€™s brain (kernel).
  
    You type a command like:
  
    **_cd Documents_**
  
    Bash takes it, understands it, and tells the computer what to do.


    ### **_Sh_** :
    Original shell (basic)
  
    ### **_Zsh_** :
    Fancy waiter, more features (managing file system)
  
    ### **_Fish_** :
    Modern interaction (files/programs)

  # File structure
  A file structure refers to how files and directories (folders) are organized in a system. Itâ€™s like a tree where folders (called directories) can contain files or other folders.

  ### **_Files_**
    A file is a container that holds data, such as text, images, videos, code, etc.
    Example: notes.txt, report.pdf, photo.jpg

  ### **_Directories (Folders)_**
    A directory is a special type of file that contains other files or directories.
    Example: Documents, Downloads, Music

  ### **_Tree-Like Structure (Hierarchical)_**
  
      /
      â”œâ”€â”€ home/
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kirandeep/
      â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/
      â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resume.pdf
      â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Music/
      â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Pictures/
      â”‚           â””â”€â”€ photo.jpg
      â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
      â”œâ”€â”€ etc/
      â””â”€â”€ var/

      / â†’ Root directory (the top of the structure)
      home/ â†’ A folder inside root
      kirandeep/ â†’ Your personal user directory
      Documents/, Music/, Pictures/ â†’ Subdirectories under your user
      Files like resume.pdf and photo.jpg are stored inside directories

  #  Path Types
  
  ### **_Absolute Path_**
    Full path from the root
    * Example: /home/amandeep/Documents/resume.pdf
  
  ### **_Relative Path_**
    Path from your current location
    * Example (if you're in amandeep): Documents/resume.pdf
  
  # Dual Boot
    Two Operating Systems on One Computer. You can choose which system to use when your computer starts.
  
  # Bare Metal Installation
    Installing an OS directly on a physical computer, not inside VMware. The OS can be installed using hard disk or pen drive.
  
  # Meta Installation
    Installing a package that installs many other related packages. It's like a "starter kit" â€” you install one thing, and it brings a bunch of things with it.

      sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
      ubuntu-desktop is a meta package

      It installs:
      * File manager
      * Desktop environment
      * Login screen
      * Wallpaper
  
  # Partitioning Scheme
    Dividing your hard disk into sections, so that each part can be used for a different purpose. Linux uses multiple partitions to keep the system organized, secure, and flexible.
      One partition for Windows
      Another for Linux
      Another for Data

  ### **_MBT(Master Boot Record)_**
    The installer automatically creates partitions. We donâ€™t have to manually set the root, swap, home, etc. It is suitable for old systems.
  
  ### **_GPT(Guided Partitioning Scheme)_**
    We have to manually set the partitions. It is suitable for new systems.

  # ISO File : A digital version of a CD/DVD
    Itâ€™s a single file that contains all the files needed to install an operating system. For example - A zip file that holds a full OS installer (like Ubuntu or Windows).
  
  # VMware :  Virtual Computer Inside Real Computer
    It's software that lets you run another operating system inside a window, like an app.
      You have Windows.
      You install VMware.
      You run Ubuntu Linux inside it â€” in a separate window.
      You can use both at the same time..
      
  # Comparison between VirtualBox and VMware
      Both are software that create virtual computers (VMs) inside real computer. We can run Linux inside Windows, or Windows inside Linux, and more..
