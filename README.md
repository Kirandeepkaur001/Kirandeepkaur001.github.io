# Daily report of training in 3rd semester training in Computer Science and Engineering
---
# DAY 1 :

### Orientation
    The day started very nicely with good motivation speeches in the auditorium. Dr. Priyanka mam gives us good motivation and told us about the infrastructure of the Computer Science department. After that, our HOD mam named Dr.Kiran Jyoti told us about the exam schemes as well as about the one year training. It was very good listening in the auditorium.
    
### First day of training
    After spending one hour in the auditorium, we were hosted to our labs for starting the training. In the lab, firstly we learned about the basics of LINUX. We learned to install the linux in our computer. There are many ways to install Linux but we installed it using Ubuntu. We were taught about the three companies-
    * **_Product based_**
    * **_Service based_**
    * **_Startup company_**

   We also differenciate between Linux and Windows. The major difference between both is that-
    * Linux is _**Open Source and Free**_
    * Windows is _**not an Open Source and needs lisence**_

   Mam give us broadly different ideas about career. Mam taught us that how we can achieve our dream company and make our future bright. In the 3rd and 4th hour,  we explored more about the applications and career options in Linux. The major career options are-
    * **_Software Engineer_**
    * **_Data Scientist_**
    * **_Cyber Security_**
    * **_Date Analyst_**
    * **_AI and ML_**

  

We also ought to know that in today's era, LINUX is broadly used in many companies and it becomes an important part nowadays as it is more secure and free. In this way, DAY 1 was full of knowledge, enthusiasm and exploration.
