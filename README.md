# In this repository, I am sharing my experience in 3rd semester training in Computer Science and Engineering
---
# DAY 1 : 
* The day started very nicely with good motivation speeches in the auditorium. Dr. Priyanka mam gives us good motivation and told us about the infrastructure of the Computer Science department. After that, our HOD mam named Dr.Kiran Jyoti told us about the exam schemes as well as about the one year training. It was very good listening in the auditorium.

* After spending one hour in the auditorium, we hosted to our labs for starting the training. In the lab, firstly we learned about the basics of LINUX. We learned to install the linux in our computer. There are many ways to install Linux but we installed it using Ubantu. We were taught about the three companies-     *__*Product based*__
    *__*Service based*__
    *__*Startup company*__
We also differenciate between Linux and Windows. The major difference between both is that Linux is *__Open Source and Free__* while Windows is *__not an Open Source__*. Mam give us broadly different ideas about career. Mam taught us that how we can achieve our dream company and make our future bright. In the 3rd and 4th hour,  we explored more about the applications and career options in Linux. The major career options are-
    *__*Software Engineer*__
    *__*Data Scientist*__
    *__*Cyber Security*__
    *__*Date Analist*__
    *__*AI and ML*__
We also ought to know that in today's era, LINUX is broadly used in many companies and it becomes an important part nowadays as it is more secure and free. In this way, DAY 1 was full of knowledge, enthusiasm and exploration.
