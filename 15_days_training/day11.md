## Semantic HTML Tags
Semantic tags are HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning of the content inside them â€” both to the browser and to developers.
* "Semantic" means meaningful.

## **_Common Semantic Tags and Their Uses:_**
| Tag         | Purpose                                             | Example                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<header>`  | Top section of a page or section (title, logo, nav) | Website logo and navbar      |
| `<nav>`     | Contains navigation links                           | Menu or sidebar links        |
| `<main>`    | Main content of the page (only one per page)        | Article or central info      |
| `<section>` | A section of related content                        | Group of related paragraphs  |
| `<article>` | Independent piece of content (like a blog post)     | News post, blog, forum reply |
| `<aside>`   | Side content, like ads or tips                      | Sidebar, related links       |
| `<footer>`  | Bottom section (contact, copyright, etc.)           | Copyright notice             |
| `<figure>`  | Wraps media like images with captions               | Image with `<figcaption>`    |
| `<mark>`    | Highlights text                                     | Search result highlight      |
